### Open Issues And Yet to Implement
1. Invite by email feature
2. Assign role
3. 404 error page on wrong url
4. Role check on direct URL visit
5. Extract styles as classes
6. Models could have had more comments on the purpose
7. Answer reports is displayed but showing wrong data sometimes
8. On creation of survey, the redirection is not happening
9. Test cases are in todo state
10. File sizes have gone large, could have refactored further more
11. A few lint errors are to be fixed
12. In a few places, naming convention has got some confusions. Underscore & hyphens are randomly used
13. Redux is not used since firebase gives a pretty good state management queries
14. localstorage could have been avoided
15. React features could have been used even better.

### Details/Bonus

The app updates the data in firebase. Please tell me your email id to get view permissions.
The DB is created using normal forms.

The app is deployed over firebase hosting server after minifying the files.

It's done in react hooks and used material-ui of react to apply responsiveness.

Overall time taken is almost 30+ hours due to DB structuring, firebase integration and API details.

Thanks!
